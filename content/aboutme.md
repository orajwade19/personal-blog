# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Omkar Rajwade**, a graduate student in computer science at Stony Brook University.  I'm (currently) interested in all systems, focusing a bit more on distributed systems. the point of this blog right now is to introduce papers I really like from my coursework to the world, and give back a bit to other computer science enthusiasts and developers the internet.
