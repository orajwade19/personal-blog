# About Me 👋

Hey there! I'm **Omkar Rajwade**, a tech enthusiast currently riding the grad school wave at Stony Brook University, set to graduate in May 2025. 🚀 My tech journey has been all about having a blast while creating cool stuff!

## Education 🎓
I'm rocking the scene with a Master's in Computer Science at Stony Brook Uni. But hey, it all started at the Maharashtra Institute of Tech in Pune, India, where I snagged my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering with a pretty sweet GPA of 9.33. 🤓

## Skills 💻
I'm a language wizard, speaking fluent C++, Python, SQL, Java, PL/SQL, PHP, and Shell. I dance with Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, Git, and OpenShift. And, oh, I groove with frameworks like NextJS and React. Let's not forget my ninja moves in Distributed Systems, Data Structures, and Algorithms. 😎

## Professional Journey 🚀
As a **Software Development Rockstar** at Amadeus in Bangalore, India, I cooked up a GDPR compliance solution that guarded 20 million user profiles. No biggie. Led the PCI DSS audit, slashed costs by 15%, and made a product fly to the cloud. 🌩️ Also, I'm a Kubernetes Cluster wrangler and Scrum Master extraordinaire.

At a Stealth Startup in Pune, I was the Software Development Intern, sprinkling some magic on data processing with Python and bash scripts. 🧙‍♂️

## Cool Projects 🤘
Check this out: I used Python to battle aliens in "Classification of astronomical data using deep learning." 🌌 Achieved 90% accuracy, no astronomers required! Also, I'm the brain behind the **Sharded and Replicated Key-value server with consensus algorithms**. Flexing my C++ muscles, you know?

## Volunteering Vibes 🌟
Spiced things up as a Web Development Volunteer for The Apprentice Project. Cooked up a user-friendly interface that boosted traffic by 25%. 🚀
