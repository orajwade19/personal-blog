# Hi there

Hey there! welcome to my CS blog. the posts on here will mostly be about systems topics, but I'm very sure I'll start posting about other topics soon as well. the point of this blog right now is to introduce papers I really like from my coursework to the world, and give back a bit to other computer science enthusiasts and developers the internet. I hope you enjoy learning from this blog, and any feedback or suggestions are welcome (the source code for this blog is public).
